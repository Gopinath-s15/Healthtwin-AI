- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Git
- Basic understanding of FastAPI and React
- Familiarity with healthcare data privacy (HIPAA knowledge preferred)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Healthtwin-AI.git
   cd Healthtwin-AI
   
   # Add upstream remote for syncing
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/yourusername/Healthtwin-AI.git
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Backend setup
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   
   # Frontend setup
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Configure pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   python test_enhanced_api.py
   cd frontend && npm test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **`feature/feature-name`**: Feature development
- **`bugfix/bug-description`**: Bug fixes
- **`hotfix/critical-fix`**: Critical production fixes

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following our coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run backend tests
   python test_enhanced_api.py
   
   # Run frontend tests
   cd frontend && npm test
   
   # Run linting
   flake8 app/
   cd frontend && npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new authentication feature"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create PR on GitHub
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh functionality
fix(api): resolve patient timeline sorting issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(auth): add unit tests for password validation
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

**Style Guide:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

**Code Quality Tools:**
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install black flake8 mypy pytest

# Format code
black app/

# Check style
flake8 app/

# Type checking
mypy app/

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

**Test Categories:**
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database tests for data operations
- Authentication and authorization tests

### Frontend Testing

**Test Categories:**
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- API integration tests
- Accessibility tests

### Test Coverage

Maintain minimum test coverage:
- Backend: 80%
- Frontend: 70%
- Critical paths: 95%

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

**Python:**
- Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Follow Google or NumPy docstring format
- Include type hints

**JavaScript:**
- Use JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document component props with PropTypes or TypeScript

### API Documentation

- Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for new endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and responses

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add setup instructions for new dependencies
- Include troubleshooting guides
